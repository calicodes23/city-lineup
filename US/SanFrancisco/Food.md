| Cali  |    5/5         | They bring things out in rapidfire so take their recommendation on ordering a few items first and slowly order more. The hallibat was outstanding and the pork buns are worth the hype. The food is very rich and filling so order a little less than you initiall expect. Everything was just outstanding and fresh and you will not go wrong with anything.           |
