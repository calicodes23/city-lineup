|  Cali |  5/5           | I literally saw God when I took a bite of the spicy chicken sandwhich. Very popular and busy for a reason. But despite how busy it is, you'll never have to wait in line long because they are good at churning out these chicken sandwhiches.         |

| Cali  |    5/5         | They bring things out in rapidfire so take their recommendation on ordering a few items first and slowly order more. The hallibat was outstanding and the pork buns are worth the hype. The food is very rich and filling so order a little less than you initiall expect. Everything was just outstanding and fresh and you will not go wrong with anything. $30+ for series of apps.          |

| Cali  | 5/5            | Everything is mindblowing. Some of the best cocktails I had, the spicy crab app was nothing like I've ever tasted. An explosion of flavor. Every is delicious and the inside is whimsical and great and they play a loop of quirky, drag clips that occured at the space. Expect to pay around $50+ for apps + main course.         |

| Cali  |  5/5           | Elevated Japanese sweets. The best mochi I've had in my life, such a smooth and creamy texture. Assortment of savory yet sweet desserts in a beautiful and well organized space.          |
